> Mustacchio is an easy Linux machine designed to practice basic web exploitation and privilege escalation techniques. The machine focuses
> on the XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability, which is used to gain initial access. It demonstrates how insecure XML processing can lead
> to the leakage of sensitive data. It also shows the insecure storage of backups (.bak) containing a SQLite database accessible from the Internet.
> A **setuid file** associated with the logging of actions on the site is used to **escalate privileges** which ultimately allows for the complete compromise
> of the system.
