# TryHackMe Writeups

<img src="./screenshots/logo.png" alt="Logo"/>

This repository contains my personal writeups for rooms completed on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).
Each writeup includes tools used, techniques applied, key takeaways, and post-exploitation notes when applicable.

Periodically I will return to the laboratories and machines I have completed and make any changes or improvements to my solutions.
